Welcome to the CHIMP HIerarchical Modeling Program.

This directory tree holds version 0.1 of CHIMP.

You may encounter bugs in the present release of CHIMP.  If you do,
please report them, as we cannot fix it if we don't know it is broken.
See below (-BUGS-) for more information on how to report bugs.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to install CHIMP on your
machine.

CHIMP is free software.  The file COPYING contains the GNU General
Public License and the terms for copying, redistributing, and modifying
this program, source code, and documentation.

-BUGS-
Before reporting any bugs please do the following:

1) Read the files included with this distribution to see if they
   contain any information concerning the difficulty you are facing.
   These files may contain a workaround to your problem or at least
   indicate that the problem is known (and perhaps being corrected).

2) Make sure it is a bug.  Try to recreate the erroneous behavior. If
   possible, isolate the cause of the problem and create a minimal
   test case which causes the problem.

3) Try to get as much information about what caused the problem as
   possible.  For example, if the program crashes, record any error
   messages which were printed to your terminal.

Once you have determined that there is indeed a bug in the software,
please report the bug in the bug tracking system on the web site:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=5085&atid=105085

Please include your name, email address, affiliation, your machine's
architecture and operating system, a detailed description of the bug and
what caused it, (if relevant) a set of inputs which cause the bug, (if
relevant) the erroneous output, and any fix or workaround you may have
found.

Thank you.
